 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
 <p>Time complexity is a conceptual analysis of an algorithm's efficiency based on the time it takes to complete as a function of the amount of input. This metric helps in understanding how the execution time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data set, aiming to achieve the most efficient algorithm possible.</p>
    <p>The concept of <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is crucial for developing algorithms that make optimal use of memory resources.</p>
